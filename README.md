## Project Description

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The aim is to identify patterns within transactional data that distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. A systematic approach is taken, starting with data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing, followed by model training and evaluation.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running:

## Usage

1. **Dataset Exploration:** Gain insights into the data structure, check for null and duplicate values, and review correlations.
2. **Visualization:** Analyze transaction distributions and correlations to understand fraud patterns.
3. **Model Training:** Split the data into training and testing sets, then train a logistic regression model.
4. **Evaluation:** Use metrics like the confusion matrix, accuracy score, ROC curve, and AUC score to evaluate model performance.

## Data Sources

- The transactional data used in this project is sourced from a credit card fraud detection dataset provided as part of the coursework.
- The dataset contains features like transaction amount, class labels (fraud/non-fraud), and anonymized transactional details.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle null values, duplicates, and anomalies in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use visualizations like histograms, correlation heatmaps, and box plots.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize features using standard scaling.
4. **Model Training:** Train a logistic regression model to classify fraudulent transactions.
5. **Evaluation:** Validate model predictions using metrics like confusion matrices and ROC curves.

---

## Results and Insights

- A logistic regression model was implemented, providing a baseline for fraud detection.
- Key metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores.
- Fraudulent transactions show distinct patterns in certain features, aiding in detection.
